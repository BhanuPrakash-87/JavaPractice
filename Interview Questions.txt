> Explain Dependency Inversion in SOLID Principle

> n+1 problem in hibernate
  1. Define method in Repository and use @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "books") for the method
  2. Use @Query and write custom query
  
> Dependency vs Dependency management
  <dependencies>: declares actual, required dependencies for a specific project.
  <dependencyManagement>: declares a set of managed dependency versions and attributes that can be inherited by child projects,
  promoting consistency and reducing redundancy in version declarations.
  
> Transitive Dependency
  MyProject depends on JUnit (direct dependency).
  JUnit depends on Hamcrest (transitive dependency of MyProject).

> How to prevent rollback in Hibernate case of any exception
  @Transactional(noRollbackFor = {MyCustomException.class, AnotherCheckedException.class})

> @Component vs @Bean annotation in spring
  @Component - Class level annotation, Spring automatically detects classes annotated with @Component and registers them as beans in the application context.
  @Bean - Method level annotation, useful when you need to create a bean from a class that you don't control (e.g., RestTemplate, )

//List<Integer> elements = Arrays.asList(32, 15, 8, 28, 45, 8, 85, 32, 14);
//Implement a method that uses **Java Stream API** to find and return all duplicated elements in the given list

//Implement a method that uses **Java Stream API** to find and return an element
//of the given list that starts with a provided value. If there is no such element - throw a RuntimeException

> Caching in SpringBoot
	Annotate your main application class or a configuration class with @EnableCaching to activate Spring's caching mechanism
	Use annotations like @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict on methods to control caching behavior

> Caching in Hibernate with Spring Boot
	First-Level Cache (L1 Cache) : This is a session-level cache, meaning it's tied to a specific EntityManager or Session instance
	Second-Level Cache (L2 Cache): This is a SessionFactory-level cache, meaning it's shared across multiple sessions and potentially multiple users.
	@Cacheable // Enables L2 caching for this entity
	
	Query Cache:
	In addition to entity caching, Hibernate also supports query caching, which caches the results of frequently executed queries.
	To enable it, set spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.cache.use_query_cache=true in application.properties and mark specific queries as cacheable using query.setCacheable(true)

Infosys:
1> What is Stack and Heapmemory
   Stack: Local primitive variables, FIFO, Allocated when method is called, Faster to access
   Heap: Objects and instance variables, Allocated runtime, Slower to access

2> How to create asynchronous API or mocroservice
   To create asynchronous microservices, use a message broker (like RabbitMQ, Kafka) to decouple services

3> What is forgate API in AWS lambda -> Used along with ECS service (Serverless)
4> What is onboarding an API

5> Java 17 features
	> Sealed Classes : Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which classes or interfaces can extend or implement them
     ex: public abstract sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle
   
	> Records :
     A special kind of class designed to simplify the declaration of immutable data-carrying classes,
     A canonical constructor that takes all record components as arguments and initializes the corresponding fields.
   
	> Text Blocks :
     Simplify working with multi-line string literals, eliminating the need for excessive escape sequences.
	 
	> Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators
	
	> Pattern Matching for instanceof :
      Object obj = "Hello Java 17!";
      if (obj instanceof String s) {System.out.println("String length: " + s.length());}

2> How to send response in xml format in spring boot
3> How to refresh authentication token for API access

4> SAGA design
    Orchestration-based : A dedicated orchestrator service manages the entire transaction flow (Single brain)
	Orchestrating a sequence of local transactions, each within a single service, and defining compensating actions to roll back changes if any step in the sequence fails
	Or 
	Choreography-based : Each service involved in the saga publishes events,
	and other services react to these events, knowing their next steps and potential compensations (Each service individual brains)
	
5> AOP Design pattern
	Spring Boot leverages Spring AOP to provide declarative services like transaction management (@Transactional) and security.
	It also allows developers to implement custom aspects
	@Aspect enables separation of cross-cutting concerns like logging which is a overhead to the business logic method.
	@Before, @After, @Around
	
6> Hashmap vs Concurrent Hashmap

	Resilience4J @CircuitBreaker, Rate Limiter, Time Limiter, Retry , Bulkhead, cache
	
	
2. How to get the second max value using stream api
3. map and flat map


4. @Qualifier and @Primary
	When 2 classes implements same interface, Autowiring the interface in our class will have issue during boot,
	Spring needs clarity on which class should be injected.
	Use @Qualifier in our class to decide or use @Primary in the class to default specify,
	If both given, @Qualifier will have precedence over @Primary,
	Use @Qualifier when YOU want to decide, Use @Primary when you want to set default.

5. How to create a functional interface
	A functional interface in Java is defined as an interface with exactly one abstract method.
	It can also contain any number of default, static, or Object class methods. 
	
6. How Optional works
	Optional is actually meant for method return type to indicate that the return might have nulls
	
7. What are Spring boot advantages over Spring
	Spring Boot:
	> No need to specify dependency version in in pom.xml (ex: Just specify started-web and jpa, The parent version internally takes care of started-web and jpa versions).
	> Just provide application.properties or properties.yml spring boot internally handles dataSource, sessionfactory, hibernate configurations.
	> Provides embedded server (Tomcat) for testing.
	> Just provide @componentScan with base package or follow proper package structure and Spring automatically scan the components.
	> Actuators are available in Spring boot (ex: Health check link, Beans initialized, disk space, CPU metrics link etc).
	
	Spring:
	> Manually identify the dependency with versions, Dependency conflict may arise.
	> dataSource, sessionfactory, hibernate configurations required in application-context.xml.
	> Manually configure server to run application.
	> Manually enable component scan (ex: beans and component-scan configuration required in servlet.xml).
	> Need to add other third party actuators
