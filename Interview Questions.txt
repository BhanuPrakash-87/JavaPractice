> Explain Dependency Inversion in SOLID Principle

> n+1 problem in hibernate
  1. Define method in Repository and use @EntityGraph(attributePaths = "books") for the method
  2. Use @Query and write custom query
  
> Dependency vs Dependency management
  <dependencies>: declares actual, required dependencies for a specific project.
  <dependencyManagement>: declares a set of managed dependency versions and attributes that can be inherited by child projects,
  promoting consistency and reducing redundancy in version declarations.
  
> Transitive Dependency
  MyProject depends on JUnit (direct dependency).
  JUnit depends on Hamcrest (transitive dependency of MyProject).

> How to prevent rollback in Hibernate case of any exception
  @Transactional(noRollbackFor = {MyCustomException.class, AnotherCheckedException.class})

> @Component vs @Bean annotation in spring
  @Component - Class level annotation, Spring automatically detects classes annotated with @Component and registers them as beans in the application context.
  @Bean - Method level annotation, useful when you need to create a bean from a class that you don't control (e.g., RestTemplate, )
  
> find the middle element of linked list in java

//List<Integer> elements = Arrays.asList(32, 15, 8, 28, 45, 8, 85, 32, 14);
//Implement a method that uses **Java Stream API** to find and return all duplicated elements in the given list

//Implement a method that uses **Java Stream API** to find and return an element
//of the given list that starts with a provided value. If there is no such element - throw a RuntimeException



Write an SQL query to select surname value + quantity of duplication of such a surname in the table with additional filter: show the surnames that are duplicated more than 4 times
SELECT
	student_name,
	COUNT(student_name) AS DuplicateCount
from student
GROUP BY student_name
HAVING COUNT(student_name) > 4;
