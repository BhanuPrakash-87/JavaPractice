Immutable class, Collections, Threads, Singleton pattern, Solid principles, HashMap and concurrentHashMap,
Dependency injections, spring boot related, volatile, synchronized and atomic variables, API based questions

S -> Single responsibility
O -> Open for extension and closed for modification
L -> Liskov substitution
     Child class must be completely substitutable for their parent class,
	 Ex: Instagram class does not support groupVideoCall method,
	 Keep all supported methods in 1 interface and for others create separate interfaces.
I -> Interface segregation
     Keep all supported methods in 1 interface and for others create separate interfaces.
D -> Dependency inversion



Dependency Injection is the actual implementation of IoC (Inversion of Control)
IoC is a principle, In Spring we use DI to achieve IoC.



volatile -> We want to expose visibility of changes to a value for diferrent threads,
            Never cached, read directly from main memory,
            Can only be used for field declarations,
            Methods, Classes, Local variable and parameters cannot be volatile,
            Use when the variable is read frequently but not modified frequently,
            volatile does not gurantee Atomicity.
Atomicity -> This is achieved by synchronized,
synchronized -> Can be used on methods or block of code,
             Only 1 thread can execute a block of code at a given time.
Visibility -> Changes done by 1 thread are visible to other threads.
Atomic Variables -> Operations on these variables, such as incrementAndGet(), compareAndSet(), or getAndSet(), are guaranteed to be atomic.
                    This means they are executed as a single, uninterrupted unit of work, even in the presence of multiple threads.

My learning -> If a volatile variable is updated and in between if another thread trying to read the value,
               There is a chance that it still reads old value and not the updated value,
               In this case of multi threaded environment, We need to use Atomic variables.
When to use Atomic variables?
I have update operation on a shared variable, I don't want to use heavy duty synchronization.



HashMap                                                concurrentHashMap
> Not synchronized (Multiple operation at a time)      > Synchronized (One operation at a time)
> Not thread safe                                      > Thread safe
> Fail-Fast (Exception during Iteration)               > Fail-Safe (Performs iteration by multiple threads)
> Allows null keys and values                          > Does not allows null keys/values
> Faster than concurrentHashMap                        > Slower than HashMap



Comparator is an interface using which we can specify our own logic for sorting by overriding compare(Object obj1, Object obj2) method.
