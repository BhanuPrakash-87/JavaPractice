"There is a table called 'Persons' which consists of several columns: 
- id: primary key, NUMBER
- surname: VARCHAR
....
Some values in 'surname' column are duplicated (e.g. in rows#1, 3, 4, 5, 7, rows#2, 8, etc.). 
Task: 
Write an SQL query to select surname value + quantity of duplication of such a surname in the table with additional filter: show the surnames that are duplicated more than 4 times. Example of the result for current values is in cell C:18"
